## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop? to rewrite code reusability, working with collections, performance, and control flow

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop? to keep running the code as long as the conditional expression is true and tells it when to stop doing what its doing

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops? how many times? a full run of the code inside of the loop

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated? before each iteration of the loop

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated? The initial expression only runs once before the loop begins to iterate

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated? The conditional expression runs before each iteration of the loop, so that our code knows whether to continue or terminate the loop.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated? The final expression gets evaluated after each iteration. Once the code inside the loops code block finishes, the final expression will kick in, and then move to the conditional expression.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`? the break statement. When a break statement is encountered, the program breaks out of the loop and continues executing the code that follows the loop (if any). It does not terminate the function, just the current loop.

- What does the `++` increment operator do? it increases the value to the variable so that the loop can move forward

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object? the for in loop
